# InterServerPorts
This is a proof of concept for enabling plugins that don't natively support inter server teleports via the BungeeCord proxy software.

It uses a map of world aliases to teleport players between servers.

If you want to test and play around with it you can get builds from the [Minebench.de Jenkins](http://ci.minebench.de/job/InterServerPorts/)
